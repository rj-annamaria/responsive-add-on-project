            <h2>Ville Valo Discusses What Went Into Neon Noir:</h2>
            <h3>“I Really Lost Myself in the Music”</h3>
            <p>
              Love Metal pioneer Ville Valo has played on stages around the
              world, getting by on his talent, charm, and charisma. Thanks to
              his time in HIM and now in his solo career, he’s garnered a
              reputation of creating music that so much heart and soul that that
              it’s easy to relate to. Those who understand what Ville Valo
              represents already know that he is one of the greatest at what he
              does. VV’s masterpiece of a solo debut album, Neon Noir, is an
              addictive 12-song wonder that showcases an enigmatic depth,
              darkness, and dazzling color palette. Although Neon Noir is an
              escapist triumph, it’s also oddly sobering as a result of its rare
              authenticity. If this exceptional album can make a raving
              supporter out of an elitist black metal freak and cultural snob
              like me, anyone should be able to appreciate its lethal beauty.
              Yes, Ville Valo is my favorite artist, and Neon Noir proves that
              he should be yours as well. We were humbled to have had the
              privilege of speaking with the artist himself, who shared the
              following insight about Neon Noir:
            </p>
            <p class="Ville">
              “… I think that the idea, at least for me — musically, and
              lyrically, and all that — wasn’t to do something that somebody
              else does but do my own thing and then hope for the best. Because
              through that, then hopefully, it is unique, and it is what it is —
              it is my own thing… I’ve worked on it [Neon Noir] by myself, most
              of it — solo recorded and produced it, and stuff like that… I
              didn’t have to make any compromises while working on it. So, for
              me, it feels really special in that sense…”

            <h3>About VV</h3>
            <p>
              For nearly 17 years Ville Valo was known as the frontman of the
              Finnish hard rock band HIM. That changed in 2017, when HIM called
              it quits. Valo had collaborated with a number of other artists and
              bands during his group’s run but launched his own solo career —
              under the moniker VV — with the album “Neon Noir.” Valo wrote and
              produced all the instrument son the album’s 12 tracks, and the set
              debuted at No. 1 in his homeland. He’s now on the road promoting
              it, offering something new from an old friend in the music world…
